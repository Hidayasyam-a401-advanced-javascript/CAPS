# CAPS

### Class-16 

### CAPS Phase 1: Begin the build of an application for a company called CAPS - The Code Academy Parcel Service. In this sprint, we’ll build out a system that emulates a real world supply chain. CAPS will simulate a delivery service where vendors (such a flower shops) will ship products using our delivery service and when our drivers deliver them, be notified that their customers received what they purchased.

### Class-17 

### CAPS Phase 2: we’ll be spreading the functionality of our CAPS application into multiple applications, so that users on different computers and connections can continue to communicate in real time as packages are prepared, picked up, and delivered.
